# Debian Scripts
This repository contains shell profiles for Debian. That is, these shell scripts are to be automatically loaded on Bash/Zsh start-up, provided the files are appropriately located on your system. There's an important common-scripts submodule in this repo, so to get this repo fully set up one needs to clone it with:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/fusion809/debian-scripts
```
